# Introduction
amlearn is a machine learning library currently being built purely for my own educational purposes featuring the most popular classification, regression and clustering algorithms. It is designed to replicate the basic functionality of the Scikit-learn library.

# Main Algorithms 

- [x] Linear Regression
- [x] Logistic Regression 
- [ ] Naive Bayes
- [ ] Basic Neural Network (Perceptron)
- [ ] Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- [ ] Decision Tree
- [ ] Random Forest
- [ ] AdaBoost
- [ ] Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- [ ] Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- [ ] K-Means Clustering
